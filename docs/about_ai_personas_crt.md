# 📖 About the AI Persona Reference Guide (CRT)

The **🧠 AI Persona Reference Guide** provides a curated catalogue of role-based AI personas
used throughout the **Cyber Resilience Toolkit (CRT)** and the companion guide
*Cyber Resilience in the Information Age — Strategic Foundations for Risk and Adaptation*.

Each persona offers a structured framing to support analysis of cyber risk, resilience,
governance, and organisational design. Personas provide perspectives — not prescriptions.

### What this module provides
- Definitions, focus areas, and contextual framing for CRT-aligned personas
- Perspectives covering strategy, architecture, threat intelligence, governance, response,
  supply-chain risk, AI assurance, and behavioural resilience
- A YAML-backed catalogue stored at `docs/catalogues/ai_personas.yaml`
- Integration with the 🔺 Triangular Navigation Program used throughout the CRT

### How to use this module
- Browse personas to understand how each role frames scenarios and systemic interactions
- Use the search field to filter by domain, concept, or persona name
- Use the A–Z filter for rapid lookup
- When working in ChatGPT or other AI tools, select a persona and use its framing to organise
  your prompts or reflective questions

### Troubleshooting
- If no personas appear, confirm that
  `docs/catalogues/ai_personas.yaml` exists and follows the expected schema
- To add or update personas, edit the YAML file directly — no code changes required
- If fields appear blank, ensure indentation and YAML list formatting are correct

### Notes
This module is **non-interactive** and serves purely as reference and framing support.
**No security, legal, operational, or policy advice is provided.**

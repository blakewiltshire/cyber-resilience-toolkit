## What This Module Surfaces

### 🌐 External Frameworks & Trusted Sources
A consolidated directory of external standards, supervisory material, and authoritative reference sources relevant to cyber, technology, and operational resilience.

### 🧠 AI Persona Reference Profiles
Role-aligned framing profiles designed for neutral, contextual interpretation of CRT catalogue structures.  
These profiles support AI-augmented analysis, without offering configuration or advisory content.

### 🗂️ Concept Index & Technical Control Families
An integrated viewer for terminology, structural themes, and control-family groupings that map into CRT catalogue logic.  
This includes index terms, glossary definitions, and technical control structures used across CRT modules.

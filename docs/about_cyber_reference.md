# 📖 About the Cyber Resilience Reference Directory

The **🌐 Cyber Resilience Reference Directory** provides a curated catalogue of authoritative
cybersecurity standards, supervisory bodies, operational resilience frameworks, and structural
taxonomies referenced throughout the Cyber Resilience Toolkit (CRT).

### What this module provides
- Cybersecurity standards and control frameworks (ISO, NIST, CIS, CSA)
- Regulatory and supervisory authorities (EU, US, UK, APAC)
- Operational resilience and continuity frameworks
- Threat libraries, research portals, and multilateral initiatives
- Reference taxonomies for consistent terminology across CRT modules

### How to use this directory
- Expand a category to browse the relevant frameworks or authorities.
- Select any entry to open the official external website.
- Use this module for quick cross-references, verification, or context when reviewing
  CRT controls, mappings, or scenarios.

### Troubleshooting
- If no entries are shown, verify that `docs/catalogues/cyber_references.yaml` exists and is correctly structured.  
- To add new items, edit the YAML catalogue with the same schema.  
- If an external link fails, the provider may have updated its URL.

### Notes
This module is **non-interactive** and provided for reference only.
**No security, legal, operational, or policy advice is provided.**
